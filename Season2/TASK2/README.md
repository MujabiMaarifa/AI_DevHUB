Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity, is a critical metric for telecommunications companies as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By identifying customers at high risk of churning, the company can implement targeted retention strategies.

This repository outlines the process of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn based on their service usage, account information, and demographic data.

1. Introduction
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the highly competitive telecommunications industry. Predicting which customers are likely to churn allows companies to proactively intervene with retention efforts, leading to reduced customer attrition and improved profitability. This project develops a predictive model to flag high-risk customers, empowering the business to make data-driven decisions.

2. Problem Statement
The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a telecommunications customer will churn (discontinue their services) or not. The model should not only predict but also provide insights into the key factors driving churn.

3. Features
This project typically involves:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, identifying correlations, and understanding churn patterns.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

Machine Learning Models: Experimenting with various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM).

Model Evaluation: Using appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC Curve).

Interpretability: Analyzing feature importance to understand churn drivers.

4. Dataset
A typical Telco Churn dataset includes information about customers' demographics, services they use, account information, and their churn status. Common features include:

Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents.

Account Information: Tenure (months customer has stayed), Contract type, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.

Services Used: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies.

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No or 1/0).

5. Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Check for initial data types, number of rows/columns, and basic statistics.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Address any missing values (e.g., in TotalCharges) through imputation or removal.

Categorical Feature Encoding: Convert categorical variables (e.g., 'Gender', 'Contract', 'InternetService') into numerical representations using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

Numerical Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features (e.g., MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Tenure) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the model.

Splitting Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Analyze distributions of individual features (histograms for numerical, count plots for categorical).

Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between features and the Churn target variable (e.g., how Contract type affects churn rate).

Correlation Matrix: Visualize correlations between numerical features.

Churn Rate Analysis: Understand the overall churn rate in the dataset and its distribution across different segments.

4. Feature Engineering
Create new, more informative features from existing ones (e.g., MonthlyCharges per Tenure, total services count).

5. Model Training
Experiment with a selection of classification algorithms suitable for binary classification.

Train models on the preprocessed training data.

(Optional) Implement techniques for handling class imbalance if the number of churned customers is significantly lower than non-churned customers (e.g., SMOTE, class weighting).

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance on the unseen test set using metrics appropriate for imbalanced datasets:

Accuracy: Overall correctness.

Precision: Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.

Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

AUC-ROC Curve: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across various thresholds.

Confusion Matrix: Visualizes true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

7. Model Interpretation
Analyze feature importance (for tree-based models) or coefficients (for linear models) to identify the most significant drivers of customer churn.

Provide actionable insights for the business based on these findings.

7. Usage
(This section will depend on your project's structure. If it's a Jupyter Notebook, you'd instruct to open it. If it's a Python script, you'd provide command-line instructions.)

Example (if using a main Python script):

Place your Telco Churn dataset file (e.g., telco_churn.csv) in the data/ directory (create if it doesn't exist).

Run the main script:

Bash

python main.py
