BERT Masked Language Model Fine-tuning on AG News
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) for a Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective using the AG News dataset. The goal is to adapt the language model's understanding to the specific domain of news articles, enhancing its performance for potential downstream NLP tasks within this domain.

1. Introduction
This repository contains the code for continual pre-training (fine-tuning) a BERT model on the AG News topic classification dataset. By training on the Masked Language Modeling task, the model learns improved contextual representations relevant to news text, which can be valuable for tasks like news classification, summarization, or information extraction.

2. Features
Masked Language Modeling (MLM): Domain adaptation of BERT via MLM objective.

Hugging Face transformers: Leverages the Trainer API for simplified training loops.

Hugging Face datasets: Efficient data loading and processing.

Dynamic Masking: Utilizes DataCollatorForLanguageModeling for robust MLM training.

Perplexity Evaluation: Standard metric for assessing language model performance.

Weights & Biases Integration: For experiment tracking and visualization (optional, configurable via TrainingArguments).

3. Dataset
The project utilizes the AG News Corpus, a widely used dataset for text classification. It consists of news articles categorized into four major topics: "World", "Sports", "Business", and "Sci/Tech". The dataset comprises 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples. For this MLM task, only the text content of the articles is used. The dataset is directly loaded via the Hugging Face datasets library.

4. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (3.8+) installed. Install the necessary libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install torch transformers datasets numpy accelerate
# For Weights & Biases logging (optional):
# pip install wandb
