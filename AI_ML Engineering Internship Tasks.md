**DevelopersHub Corporation** 

**AI/ML Engineering Internship Tasks** 

**Due Date:** 26th June 2025 

**Overview** 

As part of your AI/ML Engineering Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation, you are required to complete **at least 3 out of the following 6 tasks**. These tasks are designed to help you build a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning through real-world datasets and use cases. 

You will practice skills like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, prompt engineering, and even chatbot development — all of which are essential in AI/ML careers. 

**Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset** 

**Objective:** 

Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions. 

**Dataset:** 

Iris Dataset (CSV format, can be loaded via seaborn or downloaded) 

**Instructions:** 

● Load the dataset using `pandas`. 

● Print the shape, column names, and the first few rows using `.head()`. ● Use `.info()` and `.describe()` for summary statistics. 

● Visualize the dataset: 

○ Create a scatter plot to show relationships between features.  
○ Use histograms to show value distributions. 

○ Use box plots to identify outliers. 

● Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting. 

**Skills:** 

● Data loading and inspection using pandas 

● Descriptive statistics and data exploration 

● Basic plotting and visualization with seaborn and matplotlib 

**Task 2: Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term)** 

**Objective:** 

Use historical stock data to predict the next day's closing price. 

**Dataset:** 

Stock market data from Yahoo Finance (retrieved using the `yfinance` Python library) **Instructions:** 

● Select a stock (e.g., Apple, Tesla). 

● Load historical data using the `yfinance` library. 

● Use features like Open, High, Low, and Volume to predict the next Close price. ● Train a Linear Regression or Random Forest model. 

● Plot actual vs predicted closing prices for comparison. 

**Skills:** 

● Time series data handling 

● Regression modeling  
● Data fetching using APIs (`yfinance`) 

● Plotting predictions vs real data 

**Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction** 

**Objective:** 

Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data. 

**Dataset:** 

Heart Disease UCI Dataset (available on Kaggle) 

**Instructions:** 

● Clean the dataset (handle missing values if any). 

● Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends. 

● Train a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree). 

● Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. ● Highlight important features affecting prediction. 

**Skills:** 

● Binary classification 

● Medical data understanding and interpretation 

● Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix 

● Feature importance analysis 

**Task 4: General Health Query Chatbot (Prompt Engineering Based)**  
**Objective:** 

Create a chatbot that can answer general health-related questions using an LLM (Large Language Model). 

**Tools:** 

OpenAI GPT-3.5 via API (or use a free open-source model like Mistral-7B-Instruct on Hugging Face) 

**Instructions:** 

● Build a simple Python script or notebook that sends user queries to an LLM. 

● Use prompt engineering to make the responses friendly and clear (e.g., "Act like a helpful medical assistant"). 

● Add safety filters to avoid giving medical advice that could be harmful. ● Example queries: 

○ "What causes a sore throat?" 

○ "Is paracetamol safe for children?" 

**Skills:** 

● Prompt design and testing 

● Using APIs for LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) 

● Safety handling in chatbot responses 

● Building simple conversational agents 

**Task 5: Mental Health Support Chatbot (Fine-Tuned)** 

**Objective:** 

Build a basic chatbot that provides supportive and empathetic responses for stress, anxiety, and emotional wellness. 

**Model Base:** 

DistilGPT2, GPT-Neo, or Mistral (7B)  
**Dataset for Fine-Tuning:** 

EmpatheticDialogues (Facebook AI) 

**Instructions:** 

● Fine-tune a small LLM using Hugging Face’s Trainer API. 

● Train it to respond empathetically using real human dialogues. 

● Ensure the tone is gentle and emotionally supportive. 

● Build a command-line or Streamlit-based interface to test it. 

**Skills:** 

● Model fine-tuning with Hugging Face Transformers 

● Emotional tone design for safe chatbots 

● Conversation modeling 

● Deployment using CLI or simple web apps 

**Task 6: House Price Prediction** 

**Objective:** 

Predict house prices using property features such as size, bedrooms, and location. 

**Dataset:** 

House Price Prediction Dataset (available on Kaggle) 

**Instructions:** 

● Perform preprocessing on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. 

● Train a regression model (Linear Regression or Gradient Boosting). ● Visualize predicted prices compared to actual prices.  
● Evaluate with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RMSE. 

**Skills:** 

● Regression modeling 

● Feature scaling and selection 

● Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE) 

● Real estate data understanding 

**Submission Requirements (Checklist for Each Task)** To receive credit for a task, ensure the following: 

**1\. Jupyter Notebook**
